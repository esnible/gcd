Greek Coin Die Project

This is a dataset of coin dies produced in the ancient Greek world from roughly 650 BCE onward (currently concentrating on the Archaic and Classical periods). It consists of digitized information from traditional die studies ranging from the early 20th century CE to the present. Producing this data involves counting the number of obverse dies produced in a particular date range, as stated in that die study. Those die counts are then assigned to pre-defined periods of time, which are 25 years in length. The project is ongoing, and will be updated periodically to reflect the addition of new die studies and the expansion of its scope (the next phase will add die studies of Hellenistic states).

There are several supplemental documents that will help to make sense of the data:

- Bibliography.md will contain bibliographic information on the die studies used in creating the data.
